       What is there to say about me, I am a fun-loving, adventurous, wild at times goofball of a person. I enjoy writing, reading, watching movies, going to the gym, brewing the perfect cup of coffee, when I have time playing games, and now coding! Which is even more fun then I thought it would be.
</p>
      <p>
           I can ramble and talk about many subjects and tend to go 110% into anything I get involved with, as I a rather addictive personality, which seems will work hand in hand with coding.

       Let's talk accomplishments shall we? I waited long enough to toot my own horn, I mean this is an about me page, I don't expect to pay homage to anyone else on here.
       Kicking us off with my many accomplishments: Excel Ninja, yes I have actually been called that, I am chaotic/neutral, and turn out to be a terrible paladin when it comes to Dungeons and Dragons. my one friend owes me a debt of several million lobsters, I used to run 7 miles a day, 6 days a week until I hurt my ankle, and have been working back up to running again, and to finish it all off my best accomplishment like many peoples my final two drunken accomplishments, once slipping through a door with the chain lock on and finally creating what I dubbed a queso-pizza, by folding up pieces of pizza upon themselves like a quesodilla.
